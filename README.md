# fish

A simple program to check whether two fish are compatible in an aquarium.
Currently in the works.

To be done: 
- consider water temperature, pH requirements, and diet of each species
- consider reef compatibility for marine species
- user input system OR have program store all fish species so user simply enters name of fish without other parameters
- BuildTank.java: interactive program to help user build a fish tank
    - gives warnings if added fish is not compatible with tank and reason (e.g tank size, water type, aggression, etc)
