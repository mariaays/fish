A simple program to check whether two fish are compatible in an aquarium.
Currently in the works.

To be done: 
- consider water temperature, pH requirements, and diet of each species
- consider reef compatibility for marine species
- user input system OR have program store all fish species so user simply enters name of fish without other parameters
